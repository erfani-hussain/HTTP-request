Before you can use the `requests` module in Python, you need to ensure that it is installed on your system. You can do this by installing the module using the Python package manager, `pip`. Here are the steps:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt:** On your computer, open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or command prompt (Windows).

2. **Run the following command to install requests:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

   This command downloads and installs the `requests` module from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

3. **Wait for the installation to complete:** The `pip` tool will download and install the `requests` module and its dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, you can then use `import requests` in your Python script or interactive session to make use of the `requests` module for making HTTP requests.

In summary:

1. **Install `requests`:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Import `requests` in your Python script:**
   ```python
   import requests
   ```

After completing these steps, you'll be able to use the `requests` module in your Python code for handling HTTP requests.
